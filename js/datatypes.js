console.log("Data tyles Demo")//here no semi-colon needed or you can even use it if you cant stop yourself
//x=60 ; y="Hello" if i want to seperate two variables on one line then use ;
a=1// this will show number. this is it does like new Number(1) 
//but we dont have reference here.what it does is number=new Number(a).Something like this.if i print number then it will show somthing like we learnt in java.
b=999999//this will show number 
c=34.22//this is also show number. so js has only number,there is no primitives
d=true//this is will boolean as type
e='A'//this is show string. but in c single quotes means character.in HTML we can give value in single and double quote we said.So both will work
f="H"
g=[1,2]//this is show object.//its not array its collection
h={"name":"siyal","city":"Chandrapur"}//also object.but {1,2} will not work.this is also object but it has key:value.this is also called json
i=null//this is an object
console.log(g)
console.log(typeof g)

//how to declare a variable?
//declaring var is no mandatory but there is some importance which we will learn afterwards
var uname;
console.log(uname)//it will show undefined.its like null pointer exception like in java
var uname;
uname="Siyal"
console.log(uname)

//javascript is pure object Based Programming

//in java once i declare array i cannot change size of this.
j=[1,2,3]
console.log(j[3])//it dosent show error.it says undefined.
j[3]=4
console.log(j[3])//so array is dynamic here
/*
    in java:
    List<String> li=new ArrayList<string>();
    li.add()    we have method like this


    goto https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp
    and learn all 13 objects
